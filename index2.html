    <h1> High-Protein Zesty Chicken and Quinoa Power Bowl </h1>  <br>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
          <li>200g Chicken breast </li> 
          <li>1 cup Quinoa, cooked </li>
          <li>1/2 Avocado, sliced </li>  
          <li>1 cup Fresh spinach </li>
          <li>1/2 cup Black beans, rinsed.</li>
          <li>1 tbsp Olive oil </li>
          <li>1/2 Lemon, juiced</li>
          <li>1 tsp Garlic powder and smoked paprika</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
         </li>
    </ul>
       <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
         <li><b>Season the Protein:&nbsp;</b> Place the diced chicken in a bowl and toss with olive oil, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper until evenly coated.</li>
         <li><b>Sear the Chicken:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 6–8 minutes, turning occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F).</li>
         <li><b>Prepare the Base:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> While the chicken cooks, fluff your pre-cooked quinoa and place it in a large serving bowl.</li>
         <li><b>Sauté the Greens:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> In the last 2 minutes of cooking the chicken, toss the spinach into the pan just until it begins to wilt, then remove from heat.</li>
         <li><b>Assemble the Bowl:</b> Layer the cooked chicken, wilted spinach, and black beans over the quinoa.</li>
         <li><b>Add Healthy Fats:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Top the bowl with the sliced avocado and drizzle the fresh lemon juice over the entire dish to help with iron absorption.</li>
         <li><b>Serve: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Enjoy immediately while warm for the best texture and flavor.</li>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set in the rugged landscape of the 19th-century American West,<b>Spirit:</b> Stallion of the Cimarron follows the journey of a defiant <b>Kiger Mustang stallion</b> who serves as the leader of his herd.
         The story begins when Spirit’s natural curiosity leads him into an encounter with human civilization, resulting in his capture by the United States Cavalry. 
         Throughout the film,  <i>he resists all attempts by a relentless Colonel</i> to break his spirit, eventually forming an unlikely bond with a captive Lakota brave named <b>Little Creek.</b>
          Together, they escape and navigate a series of perilous adventures—including a daring rescue from a locomotive wreck—as Spirit struggles to find his way back to his homeland and his mare, Rain.
        <i>Ultimately, the film is a powerful celebration of freedom, resilience, and the unbreakable connection between the wild and those who respect it. </i>  </p>
       

          <p>Beyond the physical journey of returning home, the film serves <mark>as a poignant visual narrative told largely through Spirit’s internal monologue and expressive animation rather than traditional dialogue between animals.</mark>
        As he matures from a carefree foal to a hardened leader, he witnesses the rapid expansion of the Western frontier and the encroaching "Iron Horse," representing the industrialization that threatens his way of life.
        His friendship with Little Creek markchallenges his initial perception of humans as purely antagonistic, showing him that mutual respect can exist without subjugation.
        By the time Spirit finally leaps across the canyon to secure his liberty, his story has evolved into a timeless allegory for the preservation of the untamed wilderness and the endurance of the soul against overwhelming odds.</p>

            <dl> <dt><strong>Tag</strong></dt> <dd>The basic building block of HTML. Tags are keywords enclosed in angle brackets (like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) that tell the browser how to format and display content. Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g., <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code>).</dd>

<dt><strong>Element</strong></dt> <dd>An element is the entire "object" including the opening tag, the content inside, and the closing tag. For example, <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;</code> is a paragraph element.</dd>

<dt><strong>Attribute</strong></dt> <dd>Attributes provide additional information about an element. They are always placed inside the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs, like <code>src="image.jpg"</code> for an image or <code>href="index.html"</code> for a link.</dd>

<dt><strong>Semantic HTML</strong></dt> <dd>This refers to using tags that clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer (e.g., <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>). This is crucial for accessibility and Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</dd>

<dt><strong>Boilerplate</strong></dt> <dd>This is the standard "starter" code required for every HTML document to function correctly. It includes the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags.</dd> </dl>
